## Description

grnltr - a Granulator

Initial build for the Daisy Seed platform running on the [pod](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/pod).   
Now supports [kxmx_bluemchen](https://kxmx-bluemchen.recursinging.com/) as a build target.  

TLDR: Grab a .bin from the [Releases](https://github.com/jazamatronic/grnltr/releases) page and either follow the dfu instructions there or use the [Daisy Web Programmer](https://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/) to transfer the binary to your pod/bluemchen.

Clone this under the DaisyExamples/pod directory and run make to build.  
N.B. The binaries in the Release are built against the `fix/uart-rx-dma-mode` libDaisy branch.  
You should also init the kxmx_bluemchen submodule if you wish to target the bluemchen.  

Default make will build for the pod, to build for bluemchen, initialize and update the kxmx_bluemchen submodule then make with `BUILD_TARGET=bluemchen`:  

```
$ git submodule init 
$ git submodule update 
$ make BUILD_TARGET=bluemchen
$ make BUILD_TARGET=bluemchen program-dfu
```

Up to 64 Banks of 16 WAV files (total sample size per bank must be < 64MB) from an SDMMC card can be read then be granulated.  
Banks should be in separate directories under the /grnltr directory of the SDMMC card.  
Waves must be in mono s16 format.  I use sox to do conversion - something like:  

```
# convert to 16bit PCM 1 channel 48k wave
sox <in.wav> -r 48000 -c 1 -b 16 -e s <out.wav>
```

Now supports a simple grnltr.cfg text file in the bank directory, which allows passing BPM, loop and reverse information to grnltr.
An example looks like this, with one entry per line:  

```
#file,bpm,loop,rev
01.wav,97.50,True,False
02.wav,100.00,True,False
...
16.wav,113.00,True,False
```

The grnltr.cfg can be edited by hand or [grnltr_gui](https://github.com/jazamatronic/grnltr_gui) can be used to help automate its creation.  

There is now also a small record buffer for "live" pass through granulization.  
Once engaged, the buffer will fill once before grain processing starts.  
Some parameters are disabled in this mode.

Parameters are paged and the current page is indicated by the colour of LED1. Turn the encoder to change pages.  
Pressing the encoder will cycle the current sample.  This can also be done by sending MIDI NoteOn - From Note 60 (C3)  
MIDI parameters are accepted no matter what page is currently active.  
Knobs and MIDI CC messages are in "catch" mode.  
For Toggle parameters, send any CC value to toggle.

Parameters marked with a \* are disabled in live record mode.

On the bluemchen the two knobs work as for the pod.  
To emulate the buttons, long press the encoder to access parameter select mode.  
Select a parameter with the encoder, short press to activate it.  
Long press again to exit parameter select mode.  

To enter the setup menu, do an extra long press on the encoder.  
From the setup menu the MIDI channel can be selected, or a new bank of samples can be loaded by clicking on browse and then picking the desired bank.  

On the pod, the setup menu is accessed via a long press - LED1 will turn CYAN.
Button1 increments the MIDI channel, button two will cycle through the available sample banks.

## TODO  
Add recording capability: this is somewhat addressed in a passthrough mode. Recording a set number of bars and then writing to SD is not yet implemented.    
~~Add MIDI control~~    
~~Add Directory Browsing - Need a screen - target kxmx_bluemchen~~   
~~Provide a Demo~~
